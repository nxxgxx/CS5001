# Homework 08 - Submission


* Student: YOUR NAME
* Semester: SEMESTER

## Common

* List any coding practice problems you completed, feel free to comment at needed (did it help, was it too easy, etc):

* List any other resources you used to help you complete the assignment (make sure to share good ones to the Tips,Tricks, and Resources channel in teams!):
  

## Module Specific

1. What is the difference between a file and a directory?

2. What is the difference between a relative and absolute path?

3. What is the difference between a text file and a binary file?

4. When looking at program arguments, which is the first argument (sys.argv[0]) in the list for all python files?
   
5. List three python exceptions or errors, and what their purpose. For example, a ValueError represents an error when a value has the right type but inappropriate value. You can find a list here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html. Ideally, pick ones you have seen before! 


## Deeper Thinking

In this assignment, your capability to analyze and represent data greatly increased
because you are now able to handle files. Files hold the "state" of information (data)
in a computer, and because of them, we can save our state and return to a certain state between computer runs. 

However, for file types to make sense, there needs to be specifications. A specification
is an agreed upon format for how to represent data. For example, the .csv file format
is a specification for how to represent data in a comma separated value file. Many groups are formed to create specifications, and they are often open source. One  well known one is the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/), which creates specifications for the web with the [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) standard being the most well known.

Task: Write a small paragraph (3-5 sentences) about how you think specifications are created, and why they are important. You can use the W3C and HTML as an example, or any other specification you find interesting. If you look at HTML bonus if you create small webpage in HTML to show off your knowledge! (You can upload the .html repo with your submission)
